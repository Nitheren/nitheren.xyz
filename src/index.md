# Welcome all

My name is nitheren, I am a fan of all things Linux/Unix. 

On this website I will be mainly using to post blogs about my programming projects and guides about OpenBSD and Linux.

I will also be talking about my other hobbies like music, audio gear and maybe some rants into the void.
